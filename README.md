# MLNotebooks
A collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks with implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms

1. [Linear Regression Notebook](https://github.com/nikhilsaldanha/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

   Illustrates how you can train a linear regression model to fit a line to a dataset

2. [Logistic Regression Notebook](https://github.com/nikhilsaldanha/MLNotebooks/blob/master/Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)

   Binary Logistic Regression Classifier

3. [Deep Neural Network Notebook](https://github.com/nikhilsaldanha/MLNotebooks/blob/master/DNN.ipynb)
   
   Implementation of Deep Neural Network in Tensorflow

4. [Auto Encoder Notebook](https://github.com/nikhilsaldanha/MLNotebooks/blob/master/AE.ipynb)
